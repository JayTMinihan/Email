  Oh, look! A prospective Alchemist!

Hi there! Welcome to the **Alchemy Email Builder assessment**! At Alchemy, we build incredible digital experiences for P&G customers. As you can imagine, the emails that customers receive are an essential part of that experience. You might receive an email with a coupon for a [massive toilet paper roll](https://shop.charmin.com/forever-roll-ultra-soft/) or an email from your connected toothbrush to let you know that you need to step up your game. What a time to be alive! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

That's where you come in. We're looking for that special someone to work with a team of passionate designers, developers, and product folks to tackle emails head-on. If it's going to be you, you need more than the technical ability. You'll need the dedication and drive to make the email experience the best that it can be for developers and brands that work with you and, most importantly, P&G's customers.

Are you still interested? If so, see the challenge below to continue with the assessment! You can do it!

# :muscle: The Challenge

Your challenge is to take the design and code that we've provided and use them to build an outstanding email that:

- Is reasonably accurate to the design
- Works in modern email clients
- Takes full advantage of Foundation for Emails
- Is easy for other developers to understand

See each section below for further guidance.

## :art: The Design

We've included a design that we'd like you to replicate. This design isn't pixel perfect. It could use the touch of a developer to standardize some of the measurements. We've pre-sliced the assets and tossed them into the `email-assets` folder, along with the Sketch and PSD files. If you don't have Sketch or Invision, you can use this Invision and inspect mode to get better details. Head to the Code section next.
