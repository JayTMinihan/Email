  Oh, look! A prospective Alchemist!

Hi there! Welcome to the **Alchemy Email Builder assessment**! At Alchemy, we build incredible digital experiences for P&G customers. As you can imagine, the emails that customers receive are an essential part of that experience. You might receive an email with a coupon for a [massive toilet paper roll](https://shop.charmin.com/forever-roll-ultra-soft/) or an email from your connected toothbrush to let you know that you need to step up your game. What a time to be alive! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

That's where you come in. We're looking for that special someone to work with a team of passionate designers, developers, and product folks to tackle emails head-on. If it's going to be you, you need more than the technical ability. You'll need the dedication and drive to make the email experience the best that it can be for developers and brands that work with you and, most importantly, P&G's customers.

Are you still interested? If so, see the challenge below to continue with the assessment! You can do it!

# :muscle: The Challenge

Your challenge is to take the design and code that we've provided and use them to build an outstanding email that:

- Is reasonably accurate to the design
- Takes advantage of Foundation for Emails
- Is easy for other developers to understand

See each section below for further guidance.

## :art: The Design

We've included a design that we'd like you to replicate. This design isn't pixel perfect. It could use the touch of a developer to standardize some of the measurements. We've pre-sliced the assets and tossed them into the `email-assets` folder, along with the Sketch and PSD files. If you don't have Sketch or Photoshop, you can use [Invision](https://pg.invisionapp.com/share/BWXGOS29YZM). Unfortunately, we can't give you access to inspect mode, so you'll have to work out the measurements yourself. If you don't have image editing software, you can use something like [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) or download the [GNU Image Manipulation Program](https://www.gimp.org/). Head to the Code section next.

## :e-mail: The Code

We'd like you to use [Foundation for Emails](https://get.foundation/emails.html) to translate the provided design into a functioning email. If you're not familiar with Foundation for Emails, please read the [documentation](https://get.foundation/emails/docs/). We want you to take full advantage of the build system. Use SASS, Inky, and the build scripts, if possible.

We've included a Foundation for Emails project in this repo that we created using [Foundation-CLI](https://github.com/foundation/foundation-cli). You're going to want to use Foundation-CLI to make your life easier while building the email! All you need to do is clone this repo and drop it into a new repo on your Github account. Don't fork because we want to try to limit folks copying off of other assessments. Once you've got it on Github, start building! Make sure you are consistently pushing your changes! We want to see your thought process!

If you're having trouble with a particular section, you've got some freedom to move things around to make the design work. Please keep a note on the wins and struggles because we'll want to chat about that later! Don't overthink it!

NOTE: You may need to change your version of node to get Foundation CLI running. We've included an `.nvmrc` file to help you manage node versions with [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

# Taking Notes

We've created a markdown file for you called `notes.md`. In that file, we'd like to keep track of your general thoughts on the assessment, what you learned, the challenges you experienced, and what you would do if you had more time. Additionally, it's important to consistently commit with notes on what you are working on. You don't need to overthink it or format it a special way, though.

# :pencil: The Grading Criteria

We will be looking at your email, your notes and commit messages to see if your email

- Is reasonably accurate to the design
- Takes advantage of Foundation for Emails
- Is easy for other developers to understand
- Works in modern email clients
