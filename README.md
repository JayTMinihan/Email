  Oh, look! A prospective Alchemist!

Hi there! Welcome to the **Alchemy Email Builder assessment**! At Alchemy, we build incredible digital experiences for P&G customers. As you can imagine, the emails that customers receive are an essential part of that experience. You might receive an email with a coupon for a massive toilet paper roll or an email from your connected toothbrush to let you know that you need to step up your game. What a time to be alive!

That's where you come in. We're looking for that special someone to work with a team of passionate designers, developers, and product folks to tackle emails head-on. If it's going to be you, you need more than the technical ability. You'll need the dedication and drive to make the email experience the best that it can be for developers and brands that work with you and, most importantly, P&G's customers.

Are you still interested? If so, see the challenge below to continue with the assessment! You can do it! :muscle:
