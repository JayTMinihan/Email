# MyName Email Builder Notes

## General thoughts on the assessment
it is a great exercise.
## What I learned
I learned a good portion of the framework, and that there is a great deal more to learn.
Partials are the best (when they work)
## Challenges
not sure how to get the padding out from the "inverse-wiggiles"
having difficulty changing the font color for the "front end" section
still having trouble displaying inline block for the "check mark" sections

## What I would do if I had more time
I would spend more time looking through online resources to gain a better knowledge base of the framework
I would use more custom css
